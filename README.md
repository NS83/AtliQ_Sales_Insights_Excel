# AtliQ Sales Insights Excel Report
This is one of the first projects I worked on as part of Codebasics Bootcamp.

**Problem Statement**

Atliq Hardware is a company that manufactures and delivers computer hardware worldwide. The Sales Director of the company is frustrated with the number of Excel files being managed. Currently, there are no visuals reflecting the company's performance, and there are no solutions for the business problems they are facing.
Additionally, the Sales team finds it extremely tedious to sift through these Excel files for numbers before meeting with customers for annual sales agreement negotiations. They also encounter challenges in setting festive discount deals with their customers due to a lack of a concise summary of the customer's performance during the peak season at a glance. Finally, the Sales Manager aims to boost the morale of the Sales team by providing performance-based bonuses. For this purpose, he wants to compare the actual sales performance versus the target.

**Solution**

The Sales Director has hired a data analytics Team to encounter the above problems. Theteam has been provided with a requirement file that consists of a customer performance report (that includes comparison of nest sales by year) and market performance report (that includes a comparison of actual numbers with target).

**Steps followed**
1. Imported CSV files, performed ETL and data cleaning in Power Query
2. Used data model to connect fact table with dimension tables
3. Created a date table and added a fiscal year column
4. Initiated creating the report using the Pivot table
5. Added columns using dax mesured in Power Pivot
6. Performed text and conditional formatting to highlight key points

**Final Result**
